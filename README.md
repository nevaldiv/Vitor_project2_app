Project 2

ViTOR
Viability of a Torrent site on Rails


For Project 2 Im going to be pursuing a project of personal interest, mostly for exploratory purposes, the viability of the work needed to implement a torrent or other database-heavy website such as a bittorrent filesharing website.

it is going to be heavily influenced by the current website What.CD, built in what appears to be PHP.

The purposes of this would be to better teach myself the decision making process involved when working with and databases.
My takeaway from project1 was to not make anything too difficult that I was lost where to start, so initially simple CRUD functionality will be the goal. Like adding simple functionality of user-submitted files for every user to see.

After working CRUD functionality is achieved, I hope to add the user ability to search and filter through these files in a search.
